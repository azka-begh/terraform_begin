# Resources in Terraform

[Resources in Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax)

Resources are the most important part of Terraform. They are defined by resource blocks. 
A resource can define one or more infrastructure resource objects, such as VPCs, virtual machines, or DNS records, Consul key-value pair data, etc.
