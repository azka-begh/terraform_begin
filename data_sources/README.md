# Data Sources

Data sources in Terraform are used to get information about resources external to Terraform, and use them to set up your Terraform resources. For example, a list of IP addresses a cloud provider exposes. Data sources serve as a bridge between the current infrastructure and the desired configuration, allowing for more dynamic and context-aware provisioning.
