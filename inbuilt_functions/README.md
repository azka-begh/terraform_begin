[Hashicorp-Functions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/)

- Terraform functions are built-in, reusable code blocks that perform specific tasks within Terraform configurations.
  
- They make your code more dynamic and ensure your configuration is DRY.
  
- Functions allow you to perform various operations, such as converting expressions to different data types, calculating lengths, and building complex variables.
  
- These functions are split into multiple categories:

  1. String
  2. Numeric
  3. Collection
  4. Date and Time
  5. Crypto and Hash
  6. Filesystem
  7. IP Network
  8. Encoding
  9. Type Conversion
