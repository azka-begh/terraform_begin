7. contains Function: contains determines whether a given list or set contains a given single value as one of its elements.
      ### contains(list, value)
8. values Function: values takes a map and returns a list containing the values of the elements in that map.
      ### values({key:"value"}
9. keys Function: keys takes a map and returns a list containing the keys from that map.
      ### keys({key:"value"}
