# Lifecycle meta-argument

There are several attributes available for use with the lifecycle meta-argument:

1. **create_before_destroy:**
   * When Terraform determines it needs to destroy an object and recreate it, the normal behavior will create the new object after the existing one is destroyed.
   * Using this attribute, it will create the new object first and then destroy the old one. This can help reduce downtime.

2. **prevent_destroy:**
   * This lifecycle option prevents Terraform from accidentally removing critical resources.
   * This is useful to avoid downtime when a change would result in the destruction and recreation of resource.
   * This block should be used only when necessary as it will make certain configuration changes impossible.
  
3. **ignore_changes:**
   * The Terraform ignore_changes lifecycle option can be useful when attributes of a resource are updated outside of Terraform.
   * It can be used, for example, when a user manually changes tags of a resource.
   * When Terraform detects the changes the user has applied (on running terraform plan), it will ignore them and not attempt to modify the tag.
   * Attributes of the resource that need to be ignored can be specified.
   * If all attributes are to be ignored, then the all keyword can be used. This means that Terraform will never update the object but will be able to create or destroy it.

4. **replace_triggered_by:**
   * This option forces the replacement of a resource when the specified items of the resource are changed.

5. **precondition:**
   * The precondition block is used to ensure a certain condition is met before the resource is created.

6. **postcondition:**
   * The postcondition block is used to execute specific actions or checks after the resource is created.
