 * for_each works with unordered collections like a map or set, so elements are referenced by string values instead of index value.
 * The for_each meta-argument is just another way to create multiple similar instances of an infrastructure resource in a more flexible way.
 * It can be used in a resource, data, or module block.
 * It works with a map or a set of strings, and it creates an instance for each item in a map or set.
