# Splat Expressions

[Splat Expressions in Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/splat)

In Terraform, the splat expression, also known as the “splat variable” or “splat operator,” is represented by the * symbol. The splat expression is used to extract values from complex data structures, particularly when working with lists and maps. It allows you to access specific elements within a list or map and use them in your Terraform configurations.
